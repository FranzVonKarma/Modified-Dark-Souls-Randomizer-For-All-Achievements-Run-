# Modified-Dark-Souls-Randomizer-For-All-Achievements-Run-
All credits to HotPocketRemix. Only two files haves been modified so All Achievements  runs can be performed.

In the orginal version, some spells related to covenants were missing so theay have been added.
Also, the key to the seal and the coverant of Artorias have been forced to appear in certain locations so that the lordvessel is not required. If not, meeting with Kaathe may not be possible. To make things more challenging, it is possble to find them in the Painted World, so the Peculiar doll also has been forced to appear in some locations (so, again, no lordvessel required).
